Our Founder
</h2>
<h3>
Helga Hufflepuff (fl. c. 993) was a Welsh witch and was one of the four founders of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. While the other founders chose to have special students, she accepted them all without preference, but the students of her house are described as loyal and hard-working. Helga's portrait remained at Hogwarts by at least the 1980s.

<h2>
Our History
</h2>
<h3>
Hufflepuff was one of the four Houses of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.[14] Its founder was the medieval witch Helga Hufflepuff.[1] Hufflepuff was the most inclusive among the four houses, valuing hard work, dedication, patience, loyalty, and fair play rather than a particular aptitude in its members.[5][7] The emblematic animal was a badger,[3] and yellow and black were its house colours. Hufflepuff corresponded roughly to the element of earth,[4] and it was for that reason that the House colours were chosen: yellow represented wheat, while black was emblematic of soil.[2] The Hufflepuff point hourglass contained yellow diamonds.[15] Students sorted into Hufflepuff often demonstrated exceptional abilities in Herbology, owing to their correspondence to earth.

Our Head of House and Patron Ghost
</h2>
<h3>
Professor Pomona Sprout (b. 15 May)[1] was a witch who worked as Head of Hufflepuff House and Head of the Herbology department at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. She attended the school in her youth, where she was Sorted into Hufflepuff and excelled at Herbology. Some time after her graduation, Sprout returned to Hogwarts to teach.

Professor Sprout opposed Lord Voldemort during the Second Wizarding War. In 1993, she grew the Mandrakes that would later be used in the Mandrake Restorative Draught to cure those who were petrified by Slytherin's Monster. She also opposed Dolores Umbridge and her tyranny over the school in the 1995-1996 school year, which the rest of the staff were happy to join her in doing, voted for the school to remain open after the Battle of the Astronomy Tower, and assisted in ousting Severus Snape in 1998. Sprout took a group of students to the battlements during the Battle of Hogwarts and threw Devil's Snare and various other dangerous plants onto the invading Death Eaters.
She ultimately survived the War. By the early 21st century, Neville Longbottom taught Herbology, alongside her.

The Fat Friar was a wizard, who attended Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in his youth, and was sorted into Hufflepuff. He was a jolly man and very forgiving. He devoted his life to religion and, after his death, returned to the school as the resident ghost of Hufflepuff House.
